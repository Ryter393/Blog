# Blog

11-5-2017

First web development project, this is a simple responsive blog that has single page navigation with seperate pages for articles.

Intended final functionality:

Smooth scrolling between navigation anchors on the main page, and the active navbar item will change to reflect the scroll position. Front page content will be separated by a paralax background so that only one section shows at a time. 

Will have a system to easily add new articles, with a sidebar to sort by year and month.

Feature Creep: Comment System
