                    <h1>Improve Your Opinions</h1>

                    <p>An algorithm for becoming a better person</p>
                    <p>It has occurred to me that there is a common yet infrequently addressed human experience of basing opinions on involuntary negative emotions regardless of whether those emotions are actually valid.</p>
                    <p>This can often be attributed as the cause of many high profile issues such as &ldquo;homophobia&rdquo; and racism, but these things are actually not going to be the focus of this article. At this point most people know the socially acceptable stance to take on controversial issues, and maybe even the reasons behind why that has been decided as the proper stance. However, many people likely don&rsquo;t realize that they have the same problems as the people they disagree with just applied to different, and perhaps less obvious, things.</p>
                    <p>This is likely a familiar experience: </p>
                    <ol>
                    <li>Something prompts a strong negative emotion. This could come from many different sources and vary in intensity. When you hear an opinion, a lifestyle choice, a religious opinion that differs from your own, etc.</li>
                    <li>You quickly react to what you hear based on that emotion. This could encompass forming a new opinion, lashing out, being dismissive, etc.</li>
                    <li>In order to stop feeling that negative emotion, you then push the thoughts related to it out of your mind</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>You may feel that this is obvious and most people can probably think of a high profile example to show where this could lead at it&rsquo;s most extreme, which may then lead some to dismiss this advice as they don&rsquo;t plan on committing mass genocide in the foreseeable future. However, I believe this has importance to the common person in making small yet significant improvements.</p>
                    <p><strong>Recognize when something triggers a negative reaction</strong></p>
                    <p>This is the most important step, because without being mindful of why you act the way you do you cannot begin to change the actions you decide are distasteful.</p>
                    <p><strong>Dwell on it until you stop feeling that negative reaction</strong></p>
                    <p>I am not certain that this will help everyone equally, but I have found through personal experience that allowing, and sometimes forcing, myself to dwell on thoughts I find initially uncomfortable will eventually lead me to become desensitized to this feeling and allow me to approach the subject with a more logical and unbiased view. As part of this introspection, you should attempt to figure out why you feel negatively about the current subject of your thoughts.</p>
                    <p><strong>Make a logical decision</strong></p>
                    <p>If you get to the point where you can hold the subject in your mind without needing to make a hasty judgement or feel the desire to immediately push the thought away, you should be able to make a logical and well reasoned decision that is consistent with your personal values. Reaching this point is the main purpose of the algorithm, as this is what allows you to make a decision that you can be happy with. Because it will have now been properly thought out, this process should help prevent you from becoming a hypocrite while also letting you be more confident in the event you need to defend your opinion.</p>
                    <p>In order to clarify this process I would like to present an example. I was able to think of a few times off the top of my head where this algorithm led to me changing my opinion on something, but in order to avoid detracting from the main purpose of the article by having to explain my opinion I&rsquo;m going to present a specific hypothetical to illustrate this concept for further clarification.</p>
                    <p>Consider an instance in which you are with a friend and getting something to eat at a resturaunt. Towards the end of the meal you discover that your friend does not intend to tip the server. After confirming that they are serious and not just quoting Reservoir Dogs, you have the socially common reaction to discovering this information (at least in the United States). You angrily disagree, they try to explain their position, they may become angry at you for being angry at them, and before you can stop it you are now in an undesirable situation in which one or both of you has said something that they will later regret once they are no longer in the heat of the moment. </p>
                    <p>It seems likely to me that the person in this story does not know why they had such a visceral reaction to their friend&rsquo;s decision. Regardless of which side you agree with, I would be surprised if you believed that they should end their friendship over this issue. I would also be surprised if anyone reading this had not at some point felt regret for something they said in the heat of the moment. One of the objectives of this algorithm is to <em>not be in the heat of the moment</em>.</p>
                    <p>I wouldn&rsquo;t even say that it was a bad thing to have had that argument. It can be healthy and even enjoyable for friends to debate topics that they disagree about. The problem with this scenario is the regrettable actions made from involuntary emotions. </p>
                    <p>It is ok to have a bad feeling about something, and I am not suggesting that we should ignore these feelings. What I do mean is that we should strive to know why we feel the way we do, and when necessary recognize that what we are feeling is wrong.</p>
                    <p>This doesn&rsquo;t always happen right away, as some subjects are more complex than others. Sometimes it is actually quite difficult to discover why something rubs you the wrong way, and it is okay to take your time in examining why that might be. As long as you recognize that you don&rsquo;t yet have a valid reason for feeling that way and acknowledge that this means there is the possibility that you are wrong. You should also avoid acting on opinions held in this state, especially if those actions have the possibility of hurting others, as you may come to regret those actions. </p>
                    <p>In the example I gave above, the proper way to handle the situation in the event that you are unable to quickly get past the impulsive reaction would be to admit that you don&rsquo;t like your friend&rsquo;s opinion, but are not entirely sure why and need to think about it more. This can take a lot of mental fortitude as it will require you to recognize when you are unable to argue without becoming heated and to gracefully postpone until you can. Although this is difficult it will be worth the effort because by not lashing out you will have saved yourself from experiencing the much greater pain that regret would have caused later.</p>
                    <p>It&rsquo;s okay to have negative opinions of things, but it&rsquo;s not okay to put the cart before the horse by basing those opinions on negative emotions.</p>
