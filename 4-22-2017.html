                    <h1>Listen To Your Feelings, But Don't Trust Them</h1>
                    <p>I consider Stoicism to be a pretty important philosophy, and the Enchiridion of Epictetus should be required reading for anyone serious about improving their worldview. However, Stoicism is often misunderstood as being about not having feelings.</p>
                    <p>Having emotions is an inherent aspect of being human, and stoics are often viewed in pop culture as being cold, emotionless, or robotic. So when I give advice inspired by Stoic philosophy like don't trust your feelings, don't be ruled by your emotions, and write an article about distancing yourself from emotional reactions, I feel people may misconstrue this advice as telling people to not feel. Which is of course ridiculous, and likely impossible for all but the sociopaths among us.</p>
                    <p>However, there is an important distinction between feeling and acting. Just because we feel something doesn&rsquo;t mean we have to act upon it, or even should. </p>
                    <p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that many decisions which people will later regret were at the time made under the influence of strong, but invalid, emotions.</p>
                    <h4>Invalid Emotions</h4>
                    <p>By invalid emotions I mean those that aren&rsquo;t reasonable reactions to your circumstances.</p>
                    <p>Good rule of thumb: if you wouldn&rsquo;t approve of your actions without the attached emotion, then it probably isn&rsquo;t a good idea. This can be difficult, and requires being honest with yourself, though often you already know the answer (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to regret this&rdquo;) and the difficulty is in admitting it to yourself.</p>
                    <p>Poor decisions are often made under the influence of invalid emotions so by considering if you would think this was a good decision even without the feeling attached to it you can avoid making poor decisions and the regret that comes with them.</p>
